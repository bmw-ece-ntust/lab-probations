    The O-RU sends real-time data via the O1 (Management Plane) interface to the Service Management & Orchestration (SMO) platform.
    Data includes RF metrics, power levels, interference levels, temperature, and fault logs.

b) Data Processing & AI Modeling

    AI/ML algorithms in the Digital Twin model process real-time and historical data.
    Predicts failures, performance issues, and optimizes beamforming, carrier aggregation, and power settings.

c) Simulation & Optimization

    Simulates different network load conditions and external interference to find the best configurations.
    Adjusts MIMO algorithms, power levels, and carrier allocations dynamically.

d) Feedback Loop & Control

    The Digital Twin suggests optimizations via A1 (Policy Interface) to Non-RT RIC.
    Near-real-time actions are applied via E2 interface to Near-RT RIC, affecting O-DU and O-RU parameters.

### Types of ORAN Radio Unit (RU):

#### Category A O-RU

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byv4EPBqye.png)

Category A RUs, are specifically designed for deployment in remote locations such as rural areas or low-traffic zones. They are characterized by the following key features:

* Simplified Functionality: Category A RUs focus solely on the physical layer (PHY) functionalities, handling tasks like radio frequency (RF) processing, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), and digital-to-analog conversion (DAC).
* Limited Processing Power: Due to their remote deployment and simpler tasks, Category A RUs typically have lower processing power compared to Category B RUs. This translates to a more cost-effective design.
* Reliance on Centralized Processing: Category A RUs rely on centralized processing units (CPUs) located at the network core or Distributed Units (DUs) for higher-layer functionalities like scheduling, modulation/demodulation, and resource management. This centralized processing approach simplifies the design and reduces the cost of RUs at remote sites.


#### Category B O-RU

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HknL6DrqJl.png)

Category B RUs, are more versatile and powerful compared to Category A counterparts. They are designed for a wider range of deployment scenarios, including:

* Urban and suburban areas: They can handle the increased traffic demands and higher data rates required in densely populated areas.
Enterprise and industrial applications: They can cater to specific needs like private networks or industrial automation.
* Enhanced Functionality: They incorporate both PHY and lower-layer functionalities in addition to RF processing and signal conversion. This includes tasks like scheduling, modulation/demodulation, and basic resource management.
* Increased Processing Power: To handle the broader range of functionalities, Category B RUs are equipped with higher processing power compared to Category A RUs.
* Greater Autonomy: While they may still interface with centralized processing for higher-level control, Category B RUs possess greater onboard processing capabilities, allowing them to operate more independently.
