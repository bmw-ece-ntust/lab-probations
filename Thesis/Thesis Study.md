## **1. Introduction to Open RIC**
### **1.1 Definition and Purpose**
- The Open RAN Intelligent Controller (**RIC**) is a platform designed to manage and optimize Open RAN networks.
- It enables the development and testing of **rApps (Non-RT RIC applications)** and **xApps (Near-RT RIC applications)**.
- Promotes vendor-agnostic network automation, AI-driven enhancements, and interoperability.

### **1.2 RIC Components**
- **Non-RT RIC**: Manages rApps and operates at a control time scale >1 second.
- **Near-RT RIC**: Hosts xApps for real-time optimizations (~10ms-1s latency).
- **E2 Interface**: Facilitates communication between RIC and Open RAN elements (e.g., O-CU, O-DU).

## **2-Study Notes: Design and Implementation of CSI Report to Support Link Adaptation in OSC O-DU MAC Scheduler**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Overview**

- The thesis focuses on the **Channel State Information (CSI) reporting** mechanism in the **Open Source Community (OSC) O-DU MAC scheduler**.
- CSI reports are used for **link adaptation** to optimize **modulation and coding schemes (MCS)** based on real-time channel conditions.

### **1.2 Importance of CSI Reporting in 5G Networks**

- CSI enables **efficient resource allocation** and **adaptive transmission**.
- Used for **beamforming, power control, and interference management**.
- Plays a crucial role in **Open RAN (O-RAN) implementations**.

---

## **2. Background on OSC O-DU MAC Scheduler**

### **2.1 OSC O-DU (Open Distributed Unit)**

- Part of the **O-RAN Software Community (OSC)** initiative.
- Handles **Layer 2 (MAC) scheduling** and **Layer 1 (PHY) interactions**.
- Implements **dynamic resource allocation algorithms**.

### **2.2 MAC Scheduler Role**

- Determines **which users (UEs) get resources** in a given time slot.
- Uses CSI feedback to adjust **MCS, power levels, and transmission modes**.

---

## **3. CSI Reporting Mechanism**

### **3.1 Types of CSI Reports**

- **Periodic CSI**: Sent at fixed intervals, reports **channel quality indicators (CQI)**.
- **Aperiodic CSI**: Triggered by network conditions, provides detailed feedback.
- **Semi-Persistent CSI**: Optimized for reduced overhead in static environments.

### **3.2 CSI Components in Link Adaptation**

- **CQI (Channel Quality Indicator)**: Defines best MCS for a given channel.
- **PMI (Precoding Matrix Indicator)**: Guides beamforming decisions.
- **RI (Rank Indicator)**: Indicates the optimal number of layers for MIMO transmission.

### **3.3 CSI Feedback in O-DU MAC Scheduler**

- CSI is **collected from UEs** and sent to the MAC scheduler.
- Scheduler **adjusts link parameters dynamically** based on CSI.
